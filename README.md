## Project Overview

<img src="./images/Pakistan Life Savers Programme Logo.png" width="30%">

CPR for All is an initiative aimed at providing affordable and accessible CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) training to low-resource regions, with a primary focus on Pakistan. This project leverages digital fabrication techniques and user-centered design to create a low-cost CPR training model that offers immediate feedback on chest compression depth and rate. Our goal is to support organizations like the Pakistan Life Saver's Program (PLSP) in their mission to train school children and the general public in CPR, ultimately improving access to emergency medical services.

## Abstract
Bystander CPR training often relies on expensive mannequins, making it challenging for low-resource organizations to provide quality training. To address this issue, our team, comprising students from Cornell Tech and Weill Cornell Medicine, collaborated with PLSP to develop a cost-effective CPR training model. Our model utilizes readily available materials like kickballs, wood, and fabric, along with digital components like Arduino microcontrollers and sensors, to simulate chest compressions accurately. Users receive real-time feedback through LED indicators and a buzzer, allowing them to practice high-quality CPR techniques effectively.

## Extended Abstract
Bystander CPR training is crucial for saving lives during emergencies, but the cost of high-quality mannequins often poses a significant barrier for organizations in low-resource settings. Our CPR for All project addresses this challenge by creating an affordable and accessible CPR training model that offers immediate feedback on chest compression depth and rate.

### Project Highlights
- Collaborated with Weill Cornell Medicine emergency physicians and PLSP to understand the needs of low-resource CPR training programs.
- Employed user-centered design principles, including empathy mapping, user interviews, rapid prototyping, and usability testing.
- Utilized readily available materials such as kickballs, wood, and fabric to replicate the feel of chest compressions.
- Developed a feedback system using Arduino microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, LED indicators, and a buzzer.
- Created a portable and adjustable design with a carrier platform for easy transport.
- Ensured affordability and scalability, making the model accessible to different CPR training programs worldwide.
- Provided detailed instructions on how to replicate the model through an 'Instructables' document.

### Components
Our CPR training model consists of the following components:
- Kickball
- Laser-cut wood boxes
- Laser-cut stabilizing crossmembers
- 3D-printed electronics holder
- Arduino microcontroller (Adafruit QT-Py)
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)
- 5V Piezo buzzer
- Addressable RGB miniature LEDs
- Neoprene fabric cover

### Usage
When using our CPR training model, follow these steps:
1. Place the kickball in the designated wood box.
2. Position the 3D-printed electronics holder with the sensors and LEDs.
3. Begin chest compressions on the kickball.
4. Observe the LED indicators: yellow for insufficient depth, green for correct depth, red for excessive depth, and blue for proper recoil.
5. Listen for the buzzer, which confirms correct compression depth.

### Future Improvements
We are committed to continuously improving our CPR training model. Future enhancements may include:
- Decreasing the sensitivity of the depth sensor for more accurate feedback.
- Replacing the neoprene fabric with laser-etched fabric depicting a ribcage for user orientation during real emergencies.
